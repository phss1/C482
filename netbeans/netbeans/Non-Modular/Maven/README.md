## Non-modular samples for NetBeans

JavaFX 11 samples to run from NetBeans with different options and build tools

Version NetBeans [10.0](https://netbeans.apache.org/download/nb100/nb100.html)

Download an appropriate [JDK 11](https://jdk.java.net/11/) for your operating system. Make sure `JAVA_HOME` 
is properly set to the Java 11 installation directory. 

The samples assume NetBeans 10 runs on JDK 11 (this can be set editing the `etc/netbeans.conf` file
and setting `netbeans_jdkhome="/path/to/jdk11"`).

### Maven

Clone the sample, open it with NetBeans and reload the POM. Clean, build and run
from the NetBeans usual buttons.
